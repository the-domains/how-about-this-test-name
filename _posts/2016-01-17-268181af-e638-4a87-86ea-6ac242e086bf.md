Energy Matters, LLC (EM) is pleased to have the opportunity to respond to the Solar Photovoltaic Generating System for Allegany County solicitation. EM was established by Tesla Energy Partners, LLC (TEP). TEP is a subsidiary of Tesla Laboratories, Incorporated (Tesla), a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB). SunEdison, Incorporated (SunEdison) is a key EM team member. EM was originally formed to respond to the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Huntsville Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for Renewable and Alternative Energy (RAE) PPAs. USACE Huntsville made a MATOC award to EM on 27 AUG 2013\. EM is organized to provide DoD (and other government agencies) with PPAs that deliver superior solar solutions. As will be shown in this proposal, EM has performed detailed financing, development, and long term ownership preparations in anticipation of a contract award. EM is fully capable of meeting the requirements set out in this solicitation.

EM combines the respective capabilities of Tesla and SunEdison to form a coherent offering tailored to the needs of government agencies. Tesla brings experience in Deployed Solar solutions that benefit Warfighters on the battlefield, and an understanding of how state and federal markets function. SunEdison brings an extensive project development and Operations and Maintenance (O&M) portfolio, and the expertise to make new implementations. The EM core team (Tesla / SunEdison) is able perform all work required to turn a green field into an operating solar plant that delivers electricity under a PPA.

Solar plant development and financing subcontractors have been added to the team to supplement organic EM capabilities. Additional subcontractors and vendors will be included as needed throughout the performance period envisioned by this solicitation. EM has a ready team of small businesses capable of performing various functions under this contract.

Our offer relies on three key factors: 1) ensure that the solar plant design is appropriate for the two sites made available by Allegany County, 2) build the largest plants the sites will allow, and 3) deliver solicitation compliant, competitive, and realistic pricing.
